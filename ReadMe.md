## User Story

As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

Acceptance Criteria:

When I click the start button, a timer should start, and I should be presented with a question.
When I answer a question, I should be presented with another question.
When I answer a question incorrectly, time should be subtracted from the clock.
When all questions are answered, or the timer reaches 0, the game should be over.
When the game is over, I should be able to save my initials and score.
